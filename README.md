Traffic Signal Timing Optimization: From Evolution to Adaptation

The traffic simulation scenarios including the network files are borrowed from https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO/tree/main.

The traffic flow dataset associated with the work is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14653151.

The compared traditional traffic signal controllers are borrowed from https://github.com/docwza/sumolights and the compared reinforcement learning-based controllers are adapted from  https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO/tree/main.
